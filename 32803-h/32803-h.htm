<p>Parts of the letters that make up this little

somewhat, but of course only a bit, of what I
believe many a father would like to say to his

the most important year of his college life&mdash;the
Freshman. Those who first heard them,&mdash;even
though obliged to hear,&mdash;seemed to suffer
them gladly. They are, therefore, brought together,
and sent out to fathers and to sons,
and with a peculiar feeling of sympathy for
both the parent and the boy at one of the
crises of the life of each.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPI" id="CHAPI"></a>LETTERS FROM A FATHER TO HIS SON ENTERING COLLEGE</h2>


<p>My Dear Boy:&mdash;I am glad you
want to go to college. Possibly
I might send you even if you
did not want to go, yet I doubt it.
One may send a boy through college
and the boy is sent through. None
of the college is sent through him.
But if you go, I am sure a good deal
of the college will somehow get
lodged in you.</p>

<p>You will find a thousand and one
things in college which are worth
while. I wish you could have each
of them, but you can not. You have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
to use the elective system, even in
the Freshman year. The trouble is
not that so few boys do not seem to
know how to distinguish the good
from the bad, but that so many boys
do not know the better from the
good and the best from the better. I
have known thousands of college
boys, and they do not seem to distinguish,
or, if they do, they do not
seem to be able to apply the gospel
of difference.</p>

<p>You won't think me imposing on
you&mdash;will you?&mdash;if before entering
college I tell you of some things
which seem to me to be most
worthy of your having and being on
the day you get your A. B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
The first thing I wish to say to
you is that I want you to come out
of the college a thinker. But how
to make yourself a thinker is both
hard to do and hard to tell. Yet,
the one great way of making yourself
a thinker is to think. Thinking
is a practical art. It cannot be
taught. It is learned by doing.
Yet there are some subjects in the
course which seem to me to be better
fitted than others to teach you
this art. I've been trying to find out
what are some of the marks or characteristics
of these subjects. They
are, I believe, subjects which require
concentration of thought; subjects
which have clearness in their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
elements, yet which are comprehensive,
which are complex, which are
consecutive in their arrangements
of parts, each part being closely,
rigorously related to every other,
which represent continuity, of which
the different elements or parts may
be prolonged unto far reaching consequences.
Concentration in the
thinker, clearness, comprehensiveness,
complexedness, consecutiveness,
continuity&mdash;there are the six
big C's, which are marks of the subjects
which tend to create the thinker.</p>

<p>To attempt to apply each of
these marks to many different subjects
of the curriculum represents a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
long and unduly stupefying labor.
Apply them for yourself. Different
subjects have different worths for
the students, but there are certain
recognized values attached to each
coin of the intellectual realm.</p>

<p>Mathematics and pure physics
eminently represent the larger part
of these six elements which I have
named. Mathematics demands concentration.
Mathematics is, in a
sense, the mind giving itself to
certain abstract truths. What is X<sup>2</sup>
but a form of the mind? Mathematics
demands clearness of thinking
and of statement. Without
clearness mathematics is naught. It
also represents comprehensiveness.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
The large field of its truth is pressed
into its greater relationships.
Mathematical truth is complex.
Part is involved with part. It is
consecutive. Part follows part in
necessary order. It is also continuous.
It represents a graded progress.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be remembered
that the reasoning of mathematics
is unlike most reasoning which we
usually employ. Mathematical
reasoning is necessary. Most reasoning
is not necessary. That two
<i>plus</i> two equal four is a truth about
which people do not differ usually.
But reasoning in economics, such as
the protective tariff; reasoning in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
philosophy, such as the presence or
absence of innate ideas; reasoning
in history; is not absolute. I have
even wondered how far Cambridge,
standing for mathematics and the
physical sciences, has helped to
make men great. Oxford is said to
be the mother of great movements,
and it is. Here the Wesleyan
movement, and the Tractarian
movement and the Social movement,
as seen in Toynbee Hall, had
their origins. Cambridge is called
the mother of great men. Is there
any relation of cause and effect, at
Cambridge, between its emphasis
upon mathematics and the sciences
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
and the great men whom she has
helped to make?</p>

<p>Logic is the subject of a course
which embodies the six marks I have
laid down. It demands these great
elements in almost the same ways in
which mathematics demands them.
Logic, in a sense, might be called
applied or incarnate mathematics.
The man who wishes to be a thinker
should be and is the master of logic.</p>

<p>Language, too, represents almost
one half of the course of the modern
college, and it represented more
than one half of the course of the
older college. What merits has the
study of language for making the
thinker? The study of languages
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
makes no special demand on the
quality of concentration, but the
study does demand and creates comprehensiveness
and clearness. The
study represents a complex process
and requires analysis. The time-spirit
has worked and still works in
languages unto diverse and manifold
forms. Languages are developed
with a singular union of
orderliness and disorderliness. The
parts of a language are in some
cases closely related. The Greek
verb is the most highly developed
linguistic product. It is built up
with the delicacy and poise of a
child's house of blocks, yet with the
orderliness of a Greek temple. Each
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
letter represents a different meaning.
Augment, prefix, ending has
its own significance. I asked a
former Chinese minister to this
country what taught him to think.
His succinct answer was "Greek."</p>

<p>In creating the thinker, the historical
and social sciences have chief
value in their complex relationships.
Select any period of history
pregnant with great results. For
instance, select the efflorescence of
the Greek people after the Persian
wars. What were the causes of this
vast advance? Take, for instance,
the political and social condition
prevalent for thirty years in America
before the Civil War. What
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
were the causes of this war? Or,
take economic affairs&mdash;what are
the reasons for and against a protective
tariff? What are the limitations
of such a tariff? Such conditions
require comprehensive
knowledge of complex matters.
From such mastery the thinker results,&mdash;the
thinker of consideration
and considerateness. He can perceive
a series of facts and the relation
of each to each.</p>

<p>The law of values of these different
subjects in making the thinker,
is that the subjects which demand
hard thinking are most creative.
Easy subjects, or hard subjects easily
worked out, have little place in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
the making of a thinker. One must
think hard to become a hard thinker.
Subjects and methods which are
hard create the inevitable result.</p>

<p>Subjects which demand thinking
only, however, sometimes are rather
barren in result. One likes a certain
content or concreteness in the thinking
process. Abstract thinking
sometimes seems like a balloon
which has no connection with the
earth. If a balloon is to be guided,
it must be held down to <i>terra firma</i>.
The ricksha men in Japan can run
better if the carriage has a load.
The bullet must have weight
to go. A subject, therefore, which
has content may quicken thinking
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
and stimulate thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>The thinker is not made, however,
only by the subjects he studies.
In this condition the teacher has his
place, and especially the methods
of teaching and the inspiring qualities
of teaching which he represents,
have value. The dead lift of the
discipline of the mind is liable to
be a deadening process. Every subject
needs a man to vitalize it for
the ordinary student. Every graduate
recalls teachers of such strength.
He holds them in unfading gratitude
and often in deathless affection.</p>




<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPII" id="CHAPII"></a>II</h2>


<p>The second thing I want to say
to you is that I want you to be a
gentleman. How absurd it is for
me to write that to you. Of course,
you are, and, of course, you will be
one. In the creation of the gentleman
as well as of the thinker, the
personal equation counts. In fact,
it counts for more in the making of
the gentleman. For in this making
truth is less important than the personality.
In the gentleman intellectual
altruism and moral appreciativeness
are large elements. One
has to see and to understand the
personal condition with which he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
deals. If he is dull, his conduct is
as apt to give unhappiness as
pleasure.</p>

<p>In order to open the eyes of the
heart, in order to create an intellectual
conscientiousness, the study of
great literatures must be assigned a
high place. Constant and complex
needs to be such study. Literature
represents humanity. The humanities
are humanity. Literature is
style and style is the man. The
gentleman as a product represents
the homeopathic principle. The
gentleman makes the gentleman.
Certain colleges are distinguished
by the type of gentleman which
they create. It will usually be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
found, on observation or analysis,
that colleges which are distinguished
for the gracious conduct of
their teachers toward their students
are distinguished by the gracious
bearing of their graduates.</p>

<p>As a gentleman you will be a
friend and will have friends. In
this relation of friendship in its
earlier stages there is no part of life
in which it is more important for
you to exercise the virtue and grace
of reserve. Be in no haste to make
friends. Friendships are growths,
not manufactures. These growths,
too, are like the elm and the oak,
not like the willow. At this point
lies all I want to say to you about
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
joining a fraternity. If the men you
want to be your intimate friends
are members and ask you to join,
accept. If the men you do not wish
to be your intimate friends wish
you to go with them, decline. Do
not join for the sake of a blind pool
membership. Such a membership
is really a sort of social insincerity,
a lie.</p>


<hr />

<h2><a name="CHAPIII" id="CHAPIII"></a>III</h2>

<p>In the assessment of academic
values, give a high place to sound
health. The worth is so great that
very slight may be the paragraph I
write you. In the "Egoist,"
George Meredith says, "Health,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
wealth and beauty are three considerations
to be sought for in a
woman, who is to become the wife
of Sir Willoughby." Wealth and
beauty are quite as much out of
ordinary results of the education of
the American college as health
should be among those results.</p>

<p>One may be sick, and through
sickness become a saint; one may
be sick and through sickness become
a sinner. But one cannot be sick and
at the same time be as good a
worker as he would be if he were
not sick. Good workers the world
needs, and, therefore, men of first-rate
health the world needs. If one
is to be a great worker, one must
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
have great health. It is not for me
to write as would a physician, but
I may be allowed to say that in
caring for health, one should not
become self-conscious. Let me further
suggest:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;That you sleep eight
hours.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Exercise at least a half
an hour each day in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Eat much of simple
food; but not too much!</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;Don't worry.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;Play ball much (base,
foot, basket); but not too much!</p>

<p>In a word, be a good animal.</p>

<p>One of my old teachers once said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
to me after I was engaged in my
work:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you looking so
well."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because every man has to break
down three times in life. I broke
down three times; Professor Hitchcock
broke down three times; every
man must break down three times,
and the earlier the breaks come, the
better."</p>

<p>There is no need of any man's
breaking down, if he will observe
with fair respect the laws of sleep,
exercise and food.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPIV" id="CHAPIV"></a>IV</h2>

<p>I also desire that you should be
a man of scholarly sympathy and
appreciation. I can hardly hope
you will be a scholar. Yet you
may. The scholar seldom emerges.
If one out of each thousand students,
entering the American college
this year, should prove to be a
scholar, the proportion is as large
as one can hope for. For up to one
in a thousand is as big a proportion
as the world is prepared to accept.
Yet it is to be hoped that you and
that most men should have appreciation
and sympathy with scholarship.
You should know what scholarship
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
means: in work as toilsomeness,
in method as wisdom, in atmosphere
as thoroughness and patience,
in result as an addition to
the stock of human knowledge. If
you be a laborer in one field, you
should not seek, and I know you
will not seek, to discount the existence
of other fields, or despise the
laborers in those fields. If you become
an engineer, you will not condemn
the classicist as useless. If
you are a Grecian, you will not
despise the mechanical engineer as
crass and coarse.</p>

<p>One finds that the best men of
any one field or calling are more inclined
to recognize the eminence of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
the claims of other fields or callings.
Smallness spells provincialism, and
provincialism spells smallness. I
have heard one of the greatest teachers
of chemistry say that if he were
to make a boy a professor of chemistry,
he would, among other things,
first teach him Greek.</p>


<hr />

<h2><a name="CHAPV" id="CHAPV"></a>V</h2>


<p>The first principle of college life
is the principle of doing one's duty.
In your appreciation of scholarship,
your first duty is to learn your lessons.
I have known many college
men who learned their lessons, who
yet failed to get from the college
all that they ought to get. But I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
have never known a man who failed
to get his lessons, whatever else he
may have got, to receive the full advantage
of the course. The curriculum
of every good college is the resultant
of scores or of hundreds of
years of reflection and of trial. It
represents methods, content, purposes,
which many teachers through
many experiments of success and of
failure have learned are the best
forces for training mind and for
forming character.</p>

<p>But for the student to receive
worthy advantage from these forces
he is obliged to relate himself to
them by hard intellectual attention
and application. Sir Leslie Stephen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
says that the Cambridge teachers of
his time were not given to enthusiasms,
but preached common-sense,
and common-sense said: "Stick to
your triposes, grind at your mill,
and don't set the universe in order
till you have taken your bachelor's
degree." The duty of the American
college student is no less evident.
He is to stick to his triposes. His
triposes are his lessons. Among the
greatest of all teachers was Louis
Agassiz. A story has become classical
as told by the distinguished naturalist,
the late Dr. Samuel H.
Scudder, regarding the methods of
the great teacher with his students.</p>

<p>In brief the story is that Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
Scudder on going to Agassiz was
told, "'Take this fish and look at
it. We call it a Hæmulon. By and
by I will ask you what you have
seen.' ... In ten minutes I had
seen all that could be seen in that
fish.... Half an hour passed, an
hour, another hour; the fish began
to look loathsome. I turned it over
and around; looked it in the face&mdash;ghastly!&mdash;from
behind, beneath,
above, sideways, at three-quarters
view&mdash;just as ghastly. I was in despair.
At an early hour I concluded
that lunch was necessary; so, with
infinite relief, the fish was carefully
replaced in the jar, and for an hour
I was free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
"On my return I learned that
Professor Agassiz had been at the
Museum, but had gone, and would
not return for several hours....
Slowly I drew forth that hideous
fish, and, with a feeling of desperation,
again looked at it. I might
not use a magnifying glass; instruments
of all kinds were interdicted.
My two hands, my two eyes, and
the fish; it seemed a most limited
field.... At last a happy thought
struck me&mdash;I would draw the fish;
and now with surprise I began to
discover new features in the
creature....</p>

<p>"He listened attentively to my
brief rehearsal of the structure of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
parts whose names were still unknown
to me.... When I had
finished he waited, as if expecting
more, and then, with an air of disappointment,
'You have not
looked very carefully; why,' he continued
most earnestly, 'you haven't
even seen one of the most conspicuous
features of the animal, which is
as plainly before your eyes as the
animal itself. Look again! Look
again!' and he left me to my
misery.</p>

<p>"I ventured to ask what I should
do next.</p>

<p>"'Oh, look at your fish,' he said,
and left me again to my own devices.
In a little more than an hour
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
he returned and heard my new catalogue.</p>

<p>"'That is good, that is good,' he
repeated: 'but that is not all; go
on.' And so for three long days he
placed that fish before my eyes, forbidding
me to look at anything else
or use any artificial aid. 'Look,
look, look,' was his repeated injunction."</p>

<p>Doctor Scudder says that this was
the best entomological lesson he
ever had, and a lesson of which the
influence extended to the details of
every subsequent study.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the college student
to look at his fish, to thumb his
lexicon, to read his textbook, to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
study his notes, to think, and think
hard, upon the truth therein presented.
Of all the students in the
world the Scotch represent this
simple duty the best. The men at
Edinburgh, Glasgow, St. Andrews
and Aberdeen toil mightily.</p>

<p>The duty of learning one's lessons
is, in these times, opposed by
at least two elements of college life.
One is self-indulgence and the other
is athletics. Self-indulgence is a
general cause and constant. Athletics
have in the last thirty years
come to be a force more or less
dominant. Athletics represent a
mighty force for collegiate and human
betterment. Football, which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
is <i>par excellence</i> the college game,
is an admirable method of training
the man physical, the man intellectual
and the man ethical. But football
is not a college purpose; it is a
college means. It is a means for the
promotion of scholarship, for the
formation of manhood. When football
or other forms of college sport
are turned from being a method and
a means into being ends in themselves
the misfortune is lamentable.</p>

<p>At a recent Harvard commencement,
Professor Shaler, than whom
no man in Harvard was more vitally
in touch with all undergraduate interests,
spoke of the harm wrought
upon many students through their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
absorption in athletics. It cannot
be denied for an instant that many
men are hurt by giving undue attention
to sports. Of course many men
are benefited, and, are benefited
vastly, by athletics, but men who
are harmed should at once be obliged
to learn the lesson of learning
their lessons. That is the chief lesson
which they ought to learn.</p>


<hr />

<h2><a name="CHAPVI" id="CHAPVI"></a>VI</h2>


<p>In the appreciation of scholarship
is found the strain of intellectual
humility. The scholar is more
inclined to inquire than to affirm.
He is more ready to ask "What do
you think?" than to say "I know."
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
He is remote from intellectual arrogance.
Humility means greatness.
Cockiness is a token of narrowness.
The Socratic spirit of modesty is as
true a manner of wisdom as it is an
effective method of increasing wisdom.
The man who has an opinion
on all things, has no right to an
opinion on any one.</p>

<p>This intellectual sympathy and
appreciation should take on esthetic
relations. You should be a lover
of beauty as well as of wisdom.
Good books, good pictures, good
music, good architecture, should be
among your avocations. Read a
piece of good literature every day.
See a good picture or a good copy of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
one every day. Hear some good
music every day. The chapel service
may give it to you. And see
a piece of good architecture every
day. Some of the college buildings
can give it. Alas! many do not.
Such visions and hearings will soak
into your manhood.</p>

<p>All this is only saying lead the
life intellectual. You should not
only be a thinker, you should be
thoughtful. You should be a man
of large thoughtfulness. You should
be prepared to interpret life and all
phenomena in terms of the intellect.
Many of our countrymen are intelligent.
They know a great deal.
They have gathered up information
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
about many things. This information
is desultory, unrelated. Their
minds are a Brummagem drawer.
Here, by the way, lies the worthlessness
of President Eliot's list of
books to the untrained mind. To
the educated mind such books mean
much; to the uneducated, little.
Yet, as a college man, you may
know less than not a few uneducated
people may know. I don't
care. The life intellectual is more
and most important.</p>

<p>I also want you to go from the
college a good combination of a
good worker and a good loafer. To
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
be able to loaf well is not a bad
purpose of an education. The loafing
that carries along with itself the
freedom from selfishness, appreciation
of others' conditions, and
gentlemanliness, is worth commending.
Loafing that follows hard work
and prepares for hard work is one of
the best equipments of a man. Loafing
that has no object, loafing as a
vocation, is to be despised. The
late Professor Jebb wrote to his
father once from Cambridge, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> read but not very hard;
because I know better than you or
any one can tell me, how much reading
is good for the development of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
my own powers at the present time,
and will conduce to my success next
year and afterwards; and I will <i>not</i>
identify myself with what are called
in Cambridge 'the reading set,' <i>i. e.</i>,
men who read twelve hours a day
and never do anything else; (1) because
I should lose ten per cent. of
reputation (which at the university
is no bubble but real living useful
capital); (2) because the reading
set, with a few exceptions, are utterly
uncongenial to me. My set is
a set that <i>reads</i>, but does not only
read; that accomplishes one great
end of university life by mixing in
cheerful and intellectual society,
and learning the ways of the world
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
which its members are so soon to
enter; and which, without the pedantry
and cant of the 'reading
man,' turns out as good Christians,
better scholars, better men of the
world, and better gentlemen, than
those mere plodders with whom a
man is inevitably associated if he
identifies himself with the reading
set."</p>

<p>I rather like the loafing which
young Jebb indulged in, but I fear
it is a type of the life which some
college men do not follow. They
are inclined to look upon the four
college years as a respite between
the labor of the preparatory school
and the labor of business, or rather
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
they may look upon the four college
years as a life of professional leisure.
I am glad you cannot, even if
you wished to, and I know you do
not wish to, think of college as
either respite or leisure. Whether
the college is wise in allowing such
loafing, it is not for me now to say,
but I can trust you to be the proper
kind of loafer as well as of worker.</p>

<p>Indeed, I want you to have good
habits of working. In such habits
the valuation of time is of special
significance. For time is not an
agent. It does nothing. As a power,
time is absolutely worthless. As a
condition, time is of infinite worth.
Mark Pattison, the rector of Lincoln
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
College, said: "Time seems
infinite to the freshman in his first
term." But let me add that to a
senior in his last term time is a
swiftly moving opportunity. The
need of time becomes more and more
urgent as the college years go.
When Jowett was fifty-nine years
old, he wrote: "I cannot say <i>vixi</i>,
for I feel as if I were only just beginning
and had not half completed
what I had intended. If I
live twenty-five years more I will,
<i>Dei gratia</i>, accomplish a great work
for Oxford and for philosophy in
England. Activity, temperance, no
enmities, self-denial, saving eyes,
never overwork." On his seventieth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
birthday Jowett made out
what he called his Scheme of Life.
It was this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b>EIGHT YEARS OF WORK.</b></p>

<p>
  1 Year&mdash;Politics, Republic, Dialogues of Plato.<br />
  2 Years&mdash;Moral Philosophy.<br />
  2 Years&mdash;Life of Christ.<br />
  1 Year&mdash;Sermons.<br />
  2 Years&mdash;Greek Philosophy; Thales to Socrates.
</p></div>

<p>I turn over the last pages of
Jowett's "Life and Letters," and I
find a list of his works. Is there a
moral philosophy in the list? No.
A life of Christ? No. A treatise
on Greek philosophy? No. But I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
do find a volume of college sermons,
published since his death, and also
a new edition of his "Plato." One
of the most pathetic things in the
volumes that cover his life is the
constant reference to <i>agenda</i>&mdash;things
he was to do. But the <i>agenda</i>
rapidly become <i>nugae</i>&mdash;impossibilities&mdash;and
the reason was simply, as
it ever is, the lack of time.</p>

<p>To save time, take time in large
pieces. Do not cut time up into
bits. Adopt the principle of continuous
work. The mind is like a
locomotive. It requires time for
getting under headway. Under
headway it makes its own steam.
Progress gives force as force makes
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
progress. Do not slow down as long
as you run well and without undue
waste. Take advantage of momentum.
Prolonged thinking leads to
profound thinking. Steamers which
have the longest routes seek deepest
waters. Let me also counsel you
to do what must be done sometime
as soon as possible. Thus you avoid
worry. You save yourself needless
trouble and waste. You also have
the satisfaction of having the thing
done which is a very blessed satisfaction.
I would have you spring
to your work in the mood and the
way in which J. C. Shairp, in his
poem on the "Balliol Scholars,"
spoke of Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
  "With strength for labor, 'as the strength of ten'<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;    To ceaseless toil he girt him night and day:<br />
  A native King and ruler among men,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Ploughman or Premier, born to bear true sway:<br />
  Small or great duty never known to shirk,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;    He bounded joyously to sternest work&mdash;<br />
  Lest buoyant others turn to sport and play."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Therefore, do not be a slave. Go
at your job with enthusiasm. To
get enthusiasm in work, work.
Work creates enthusiasm for work
in a healthy mind. The dyer's hand
is not subdued to its materials; it is
strengthened through materials for
service.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPVIII" id="CHAPVIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p>You will soon learn, my son, that
college men are, as a rule, sound in
body, sane in mind, in heart pure,
in will vigorous, keen in conscience,
and filled with noble aspirations.
Such men usually interpret life,
both academic and general, in
sanity and in justice.</p>

<p>Yet, despite these happy conditions,
there does prevail a danger
of college men making certain misconceptions
of college life.</p>

<p>A misconception which is more or
less common among students you
will soon have occasion to see relates
to the failure to distinguish,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
on the one side, knowledge from
efficiency, and on the other, knowledge
from cultivation. In the
former time, the worth of knowledge,
as knowledge, was emphasized
in the college. The man who knew
was regarded as the great man. To
make each student an encyclopedia
of information was a not uncommon
aim. It is certainly well to know.
Scholarship is seldom in peril of receiving
too high encomium. Yet,
knowledge is not power. Sometimes
knowledge prevents the creation,
or retention, or use, of power.
The intellect may be so clogged with
knowledge that the will becomes
sluggish or irregular in its action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
Knowledge, however, is always
to be so gathered that it shall create
power and minister to efficiency.
The accumulation of information is
to be made with such orderliness,
accuracy, thoroughness and comprehensiveness,
that these qualities
shall represent the chief and lasting
result of knowledge. Facts may be
forgotten, but the orderliness, accuracy,
thoroughness and comprehensiveness
in which these facts
have been gathered are more important
than the facts themselves,
and these qualities should, and may,
become a permanent intellectual
treasure. These qualities are elements
of efficiency. They are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
forces for making attainments, for
securing results. The student,
however, while he is securing the
facts which lead to these qualities
is in peril of forgetting the primary
value of the qualities themselves.</p>

<p>On the other side, the student is
also in peril of failing to distinguish
between knowledge as knowledge,
and knowledge which leads to personal
cultivation. What is cultivation,
and who is the cultivated person?
Some would say that the cultivated
person is the person of beautiful
manners, of the best knowledge
of life's best things, who is at
home in any society or association.
Such a definition is not to be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
spurned. For, is it not said that
"Manners make the man"? Manners
make the man! That is, Do
manners create the man? that is,
Do manners give reputation to the
man? that is, Do manners express
the character of the man? Which
of the three interpretations is
sound? Or does each interpretation
intimate a side of the polygon?</p>

<p>I know of a man put in nomination
for a place in an historic college.
The trustees were in doubt
respecting his bearing in certain
social relations. As a test, I may
say, he was asked to be a guest at
an afternoon tea. Rather silly way,
in some respects, wasn't it? I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
doubt if he to this day is aware of
the trial to which he was subjected.
The way one accepts or declines a
note of invitation, the way one uses
his voice, the way one enters or
retires from a room may, or may not,
be little in itself, but the simple act
is evidence of conditions. For is
not manner the comparative of
man? I would not say it is the
superlative.</p>

<p>Others would affirm that the cultivated
person is the person who
appreciates the best which life offers.
Appreciation is intellectual,
emotional, volitional. It is discrimination
<i>plus</i> sympathy. It contains
a dash of admiration. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>
recognizes and adopts the best in
every achievement, in the arts of
literature, poetry, sculpture, painting,
architecture. The cultivated
person seeks out the least unworthy
in the unworthy, and the most
worthy in that which is at all
worthy. The person of cultivation
knows, compares, relates, judges.
He has standards and he applies
them to things, measures methods.
He is able to discriminate
and to feel the difference between
the Parthenon and the Madeleine,
between a poem of Tennyson and
one of Longfellow. His moral
nature is fine, as his intellectual is
honest. He is filled with reverence
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>
for truth, duty, righteousness. He
is humble, for he knows how great
is truth, how imperative, duty. He
is modest, for he respects others. He
is patient with others and with himself,
for he knows how unattainable
is the right. He can be silent when
in doubt. He can speak alone when
truth is unpopular. He is willing
to lose his voice in the "choir invisible"
when it chants either the
Miserere or the Gloria in Excelsis.
He is a man of proportion, of reality,
sincerity, honesty, justice, temperance&mdash;intellectual
and ethical.</p>

<p>The college man is in peril of forgetting
the worth of cultivation.
Knowledge should lead to cultivation,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
but, as in the case of securing
efficiency, the mind of the student
may be so fixed upon processes as to
fail to recognize the importance of
the result as manifest in the cultivation
of his whole being.</p>

<p>In the case of both efficiency and
cultivation, the student is to remember
there is no substitute. Intellectual
power cannot be counterfeited.
Any attempt, also, to
secure a sham cultivation is foreordained
to failure.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPIX" id="CHAPIX"></a>IX</h2>


<p>The student is also too prone to
distinguish between academic
morals and human morals. As a student,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
he may crib in examination
without compunction. As a student,
he too often feels it is right
to deceive his teacher. Students
who are gentlemen and who would
as soon cut their own throats as steal
your purse, will yet steal your office
sign or the pole of your barber. In
such college outlawry he loses no
sense of self-respect, and in no degree
the respect of his fellow students.
Let us confess at once that
in what may be called academic
immorals there is usually no sense
of malice. This condition does
create a distinct difference between
academic and human ethics. Let
the distinction be given full credit.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
Yet, be it at once and firmly said,
a lie is a lie, and thieving is thieving.
The blameworthiness may differ in
different cases, but there is always
blameworthiness.</p>

<p>Be it also said the public does not
usually recognize the distinction
which the student himself seeks to
make. The public becomes justly
impatient with, and more or less indignant
over, the horseplay, or immoralities
which students work outside,
and sometimes inside, college
walls. The student is to remember
that before he was a student he was
a man, that after he has ceased to be
a student he is to be a man, and
while he is a student he is also to be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
a man, and also before, after, and
always he is to be a gentleman.
Such irregular conditions belong, of
course, to youth as well as to the
student. The irreverence which
characterizes all American life is
prone to become insolence, when, in
the student, it is raised to the second
or third power. The able man and
true&mdash;student or not a student&mdash;of
course presently adjusts himself to
orderly conditions. The academic
experience proves to be a discipline,
though sometimes not a happy one,
and the discipline helps towards the
achievement of a large and rich
character.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPX" id="CHAPX"></a>X</h2>

<p>Another misconception made by
the student is also common. It is
a misconception attaching to any
weakness of his character. The
student is inclined to believe that
there may be weaknesses which are
not structural. He may think that
there may be some weakness in one
part of his whole being which shall
not affect his whole being. He may
believe that he can skimp his intellectual
labor without making his
moral nature thin, or that he can
break the laws of his moral nature
without breaking his intellectual
integrity. He may think that he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
can play fast and loose with his will
without weakening his conscience or
without impairing the truthfulness
of his intellectual processes. He
may imagine that he is composed of
several distinct potencies and that
he can lessen the force of any one
of them without depreciating the
value of the others. Lamentable
mistake, and one often irretrievable.
For man is a unit. Weakness in one
part becomes weakness in every
part. In the case of the body, the
illness of one organ damages all
organs. If the intellect be dull, or
narrow in its vision, or false in its
logic, the heart refuses to be quickened
and the conscience is disturbed.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
If the heart be frigid, the intellect,
in turn, declines to do its task with
alertness or vigor. If conscience be
outraged, the intellect loses force
and the heart becomes clothed with
shame. Man is one. Strength in
one part is strength in, and for, every
part, and weakness in one part results
in weakness in, and for, every
part.</p>

<p>For avoiding these three misconceptions,
the simple will of the college
man is of primary worth. If
he will to distinguish knowledge
from efficiency, and knowledge
from cultivation, if he will to know
that the distinction between academic
morals and human morals is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
not so deep as some believe, and if
he will to believe in the unity of
character, the student has the primary
help for securing a sound idea
and a right practice.</p>


<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPXI" id="CHAPXI"></a>XI</h2>


<p>I write to you, my boy, out of the
experience and observation of thirty
years in which I have followed as
best I could the careers of graduates
of many of our colleges. The other
afternoon I set down the names of
some of these graduates of the two
colleges which I know best. Among
them were men who, fifteen or
thirty years after their graduation,
are doing first-rate work. They are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>
lawyers, editors, physicians, judges,
clergymen, teachers, merchants,
manufacturers, architects and writers.
As I have looked at the list
with a mind somewhat inquisitive I
have asked myself what are the
qualities or conditions which have
contributed to the winning of the
great results which these men have
won.</p>

<p>The answers which I have given
myself are manifold. For it is always
difficult in personal matters to
differentiate and to determine
causes. In mechanical concerns it
is not difficult. But in the calculation
of causes which constitute the
value of a person as a working
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>
force one often finds oneself baffled.
The result frequently seems either
more or less than an equivalent of
the co-operating forces. The personal
factor, the personal equation
counts immensely. These values
we cannot measure in scales or figure
out by the four processes of
arithmetic.</p>

<p>Be it said that the causes of the
success of these men do not lie in
their conditions. No happy combination
of circumstances, no windfall
of chance, gave them what they
have achieved. If those who graduated
in the eighth decade had graduated
in the ninth, or if those who
graduated in the ninth had graduated
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
in the earlier time, it probably
would have made no difference.
Neither does the name, with possibly
a single exception, nor wealth prove
to be a special aid. Nor have
friends boosted or pushed them.
Friends may have opened doors for
them; but friends have not urged
them either to see or to embrace opportunities.</p>

<p>These men seem to me to have
for their primary and comprehensive
characteristic a large sanity.
They have the broad vision and the
long look. They possess usually a
kind of sobriety which may almost
be called Washingtonian. The insane
man reasons correctly from false
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
premises. The fool has no premises
from which to reason. These men
are neither insane nor foolish. They
have suppositions, presuppositions,
which are true. They also follow
logical principles which are sound.
They are in every way well-ordered.
They keep their brains where their
brains ought to be&mdash;inside their
skulls. They keep their hearts
where their hearts ought to be&mdash;inside
their chests. They keep their
appetites where their appetites
ought to be. Too many men keep
their brains inside their chests: the
emotions absorb the intellect. Too
many men put their hearts inside
their skull: the emotions are dried
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
up in the clear air of thought. Too
many put both brains and heart
where the appetites are: both judgment
and action are swallowed up
in the animal.</p>

<p>But these men are whole, wholesome,
healthy, healthful. They
seem to represent those qualities
which, James Bryce says, Archbishop
Tait embodied: "He had
not merely moderation, but what,
though often confounded with
moderation, is something rarer and
better, a steady balance of mind.
He was carried about by no winds
of doctrine. He seldom yielded to
impulses, and was never so seduced
by any one theory as to lose sight of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>
other views and conditions which
had to be regarded. He knew how
to be dignified without assumption,
firm without vehemence, prudent
without timidity, judicious without
coldness." They are remote from
crankiness, eccentricity. They may
or may not have fads; but they are
not faddists. Not one of them is a
genius in either the good or the evil
side of conspicuous native power.
They see and weigh evidence. They
are a happy union of wit and wisdom,
of jest and precept, of work
and play, of companionship and
solitude, of thinking and resting, of
receptivity and creativeness, of the
ideal and the practical, of individualism
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
and of sympathy. They are
living in the day, but they are not
living for the day. They embody
the doctrine of the golden mean.</p>

<p>Each of these men has also in
his career usually more than filled
the place he occupied. He has
overflowed into the next higher
place. The overflow has raised him
into the higher lock. The career
has been an ascending spiral. Each
higher curve has sprung out of the
preceding and lower. From the
attorneyship of the county to service
as attorney of the State, and
to a place on the Supreme Bench of
the United States:&mdash;From a pastorate
in a small Maine city to a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
pastorate suburban, and from the pastorate
suburban to a pastorate on
Fifth Avenue:&mdash;From a professorship
in an humble place to a professorship
in largest relations:&mdash;From
the building of cottages to the
building of great libraries and
museums. This is the order of progression.
I will not say that any of
these men did the best he could do
at every step of the way. Some did;
some did not, probably. But what
is to the point, each did better than
the place demanded. He more than
earned his wages, his salary, his pay.
He had a surplus; he was a creditor.
His employers owed him more than
they paid him. They found the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
best way of paying him and keeping
him was to advance him.</p>

<p>Such is the natural evolution of
skill and power. The only legitimate
method of advancement is to
make advancement necessary, inevitable,
by the simple law of
achievement. The simple law of
achievement depends upon the law
of increasing force, which is the law
that personal force grows through
the use of personal force.</p>

<p>Hiram Stevens Maxim in the
sketch of his life tells of his working
in Flynt's carriage factory at Abbot,
Maine, when a boy of about fifteen.
From Flynt's at Abbot he went to
Dexter, a large town, where he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
became a foreman. He presently
went to a threshing machine factory
in northern New York; thence to
Fitchburg, Mass., where he obtained
a place in the engineering
works of his uncle. In this factory
he says he could do more work than
any other man save one. Thence
he went to a place in Boston; from
Boston to New York, where he received
high pay as a draughtsman.
While he was working in New
York he conceived the idea of
making a gun which would load and
fire itself by the energy derived
from the burning powder. From
work in a little place in Maine,
Maxim, by doing each work the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>
best possible, has made himself a
larger power.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these men represent
goodfellowship. They embody
friendliness. The late Robert Lowe
(Viscount Sherbrooke) was at one
time esteemed to be the equal of
John Bright and of Gladstone in
oratory, and their superior in intellect.
He died in 1892 unknown
and unlamented. He failed by
reason of a lack of friendliness.
Lowe was once an examiner at Oxford.
Into an oral examination
which he was conducting a friend
came and asked how he was getting
on. "Excellently," replied Lowe,
"five men flunked already and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
sixth is shaky." Ability without
goodfellowship is usually ineffective;
good ability <i>plus</i> good fellowship
makes for great results.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere of friendliness,
these men are practising the
Golden Rule. They are not advertising
the fact. They do much
in this atmosphere of friendliness
for large bodies of people. They
follow the sentiment which Pasteur
expressed near the close of his great
career: "Say to yourselves first:
'What have I done for my instruction?'
and, as you gradually advance,
'What have I done for my
country?' until the time comes
when you may have the immense
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>
happiness of thinking that you have
contributed in some way to the progress
and to the good of humanity.
But whether our efforts are or are
not favored by life, let us be able
to say when we come near the great
goal: 'I have done what I could.'"
They have done much for the individual,
for the local neighborhood.
They have given themselves in numberless
services, boards, committees,
commissions&mdash;works which count
much in time and strength. These
services constitute no small share of
the worth of a commonwealth, of a
community.</p>

<p>To one relation of these men I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>
wish especially to refer. This is
their relation to wealth. Some of
these men are business men. Wealth
is one of the normal results of business.
Some of these men are professional
men. Wealth is not the
normal result of professional service.
But the seeking of wealth has
not in the life and endeavor of
these men played a conspicuous
part. If wealth is the primary purpose,
they keep the purpose to
themselves. They do not talk much
about it. But most of them do not
hold wealth as a primary purpose.
Rather their primary and atmospheric
aim is to serve the community
through their business. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>
same purpose moves them which
also moves the lawyer, the minister,
the doctor. Life, not living, is their
principle.</p>

<p>To one further element I must
refer. It comprehends, perhaps,
much that I have been trying to say
to you, my son. These men kept,
and are keeping themselves to their
work. They do not waste themselves.
They are economical of
time and strength. The late Provost
Pepper of the University of
Pennsylvania said (in a manuscript
not formally published): "Many
can do with less than eight or even
seven hours of sleep while working
hard, provided they recognize the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>
increased risk; that while running
their engine they take more scrupulous
care with every part of the machinery.
Machine must be perfect,
fuel ditto; everything must be sacrificed
to the one point of keeping
the machinery running thus: Subjection
of carnal, emotional excesses;
certainty that no weak spots
exist; diet, especially too much eating,
too fast eating; stimulants, tobacco,
open-air exercise; cool-headed,
almost callous, critical
analysis of oneself, one's sensations
and effect of work on the system;
clear knowledge of danger lines; result,
avoidance of transgressing, and
immediate summons at right time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>
These men are men of self-restraint.
They are like rivers having
dams, keeping their waters back in
order that the water may be used
more effectively. They are free
from entangling alliances. They
are not men of one thing; they
are often men of two, three, a
dozen things. But one thing is primary,
the others secondary. They
may have avocations; but they have
only one vocation. "This one thing
I do." I have already quoted from
Pasteur. Of him it is said by his
biographer: "In the evening, after
dinner, he usually perambulated
the hall and corridor of his rooms at
the École Normale, cogitating over
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
various details of his work. At ten
o'clock he went to bed, and at eight
the next morning, whether he had
had a good night or a bad one, he
resumed his work in the laboratory."
His wife wrote to their
children: "Your father is absorbed
in his thoughts, talks little, sleeps
little, rises at dawn, and in one
word, continues the life I began
with him this day thirty-five years
ago." Learn from the Frenchman,
my boy!</p>

<p>Keeping themselves at their one
work these men embody a sense of
duty. I find they have a conscience.
Their conscience is not worn outside,
but inside, their bosom. They
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>
make no show of doing what they
ought. They simply do what they
are called upon to do&mdash;and that is
all there is to it. It was said of a
first scholar in an historic college
that he was never caught working.
These same men may, or may not
be caught working, but they do
work, and their work is a normal
and moral part of their being.</p>

<p>But your face, my son, is rather
toward your own future than toward
the past of other men. But
your own future is as nothing save
as it touches other men. Therefore,
do have an enthusiasm for man
as man. Enthusiasm for humanity
has its basis in love for man as man,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
in a belief in the indefinite progress
of man and in a determination to
promote that progress. In a posthumous
romance of Hawthorne the
heroine points out to her lover the
service which they will give to mankind
in successive endless generations.
In one age, poverty shall be
wiped out; in another, passion and
hatred and jealousy shall cease; in
a third, beauty shall take the place
of ugliness, happiness of pain, and
generosity of niggardliness. In
reality, not in romance, every student
is to feel a passion for human
service. These toiling and tired
brothers and sisters are to be loved,
not with a mere emotional affection,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
but with a mighty will. One is to
adopt the principle of Gladstone
and not of the Marquis of Salisbury
in relation to humanity.</p>

<p>The student also is to believe
that the human brotherhood is capable
of indefinite progress. The law
of evolution makes the belief in
human perfectibility easy; the principles
of religion make the belief
glorious. Slow is the progress. One
generation turns the jack-screw of
uplifting one thread; but it is a
thread. Humanity does rise. Linked
with this love for man and the assurance
of his progress the college
man is to determine himself to advance
this progress. Whatever his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
condition, whatever his ability, he
is to do his part. As is said in that
noble epitaph to Wordsworth,
placed in the little church at Grasmere,
each is to be "a minister of
high and sacred truth."</p>

<p>I want you to come out from the
college with a determination to do
something worth while. It is rather
singular how political ambitions
have ceased among graduates.
Some say all ambition has ceased
among college men. I do not believe
it. The softer times may not
nurse the sturdier virtues; but men
are still men. The words which
Stevenson wanted put on his tombstone:
"He clung to his paddle,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
and the words of George Eliot:
"Don't take opium," and the
words of Carlyle: "Burn your own
smoke," are still characteristic of
college men. Men are still moved
by the great things, and by such inspiration
they are inspired great
things to do.</p>

<p>I am not, I think, going too far
if I refer to one very personal matter,
my son. I mean your relation
to the Supreme Being. That Being
may be conceived under many
forms, as Love, as Omnipotent
Force, as Omniscient Knowledge,
as Perfect Beauty, as Absolute
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>
Right. The college man interprets
the Supreme Being under at least
one of these forms; and he may be
able to interpret him under all of
these forms. To this Being he
should relate himself. Let the college
man learn, and learn all; but
he should not neglect to learn of
the Divine Being. The college
man should love, and love every
object as it is worthy of loving; but
he should not decline to love the
Supreme Being. For He is Supreme.</p>

<p>The college man is to follow the
wisest leadership, to obey the highest
principles, to give himself to the
contemplation of the sublimest; but
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>
his following, his obedience, his
self-surrender are to bring him to
and keep him with the Being Supreme.
Religion thus broadly interpreted
makes a keen and mighty
appeal to the college man. Let the
college man be religious; let not the
college man have a religion. Let
religion be a fundamental element
of his character, and not a quality
of his changing self. His religion,
like that of every other man, should
first be human, not scholastic; first
essential and natural, not arbitrary.</p>

<p>Be religious. It sounds almost
goodish, but I know you do not
think it such. Be religious. Relate
yourself to something. Relate yourself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>
to some What. Or relate yourself
to some Who: beyond whatever
your eye sees or your hand touches.
I do not care how you put it. If I
were a Buddhist, I would say, worship
Buddha. Be what the great
image at Kamakura represents. If
I were a Mohammedan, I would say,
follow the teachings of the Koran,
and pray. I am, and you are, a
Christian. Therefore I say: Love
your God. Follow the example of
the Christ. Be one of that company
who accept his guidance and are
seeking to do his will in the bettering
of the world.</p>

<p>Good-bye, dear boy, I have
written too long, but it has done me
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
good to write. If it does you a
quarter of the good to read, I shall
be grateful.</p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>
